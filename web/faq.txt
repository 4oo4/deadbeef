Q: How do I make GDB backtrace after crash or hang?

A: Ensure that you have unstripped binary. Most packages are stripped. So you'll have to build yourself in most cases, if you haven't done so already.
Simply doing "./configure && make && sudo make install" is sufficient, but it's better to add export CFLAGS="-O0 -g".
1. install GDB
2. run "gdb deadbeef", and execute "r" command in GDB shell
3. reproduce a crash, or press ctrl+c in GDB after hang occurs
4. execute "thread 1" command, followed by "bt" command in GDB
5. repeat for at least 5 threads: tread 2<enter> bt<enter>, and so on
6. now, you can copy the output starting after 1st "bt" command into email/pastebin/textfile, etc.
