Q: I don't get it. Yes, indeed I have PulseAudio, but in Deadbeef I select ALSA output, and I get playback problems.

A: PulseAudio tricks applications by providing ALSA-plugin that routes sound from application to PulseAudio via ALSA API.

Q: Playlist, settings, etc are not saved if I kill X session, shut down or restart computer, etc
